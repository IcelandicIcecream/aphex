description: Aphex CMS - A database-agnostic, Sanity-inspired content management system built with SvelteKit.
---

Aphex is a headless CMS built with SvelteKit and Svelte 5. It takes inspiration from Sanity's schema-driven approach while being fully database-agnostic through a ports and adapters architecture.

## Key Features

- **Schema-driven** - Define your content model with TypeScript. Get a full admin UI, API, and database schema automatically.
- **Database-agnostic** - Ships with PostgreSQL support via Drizzle ORM. Bring your own adapter for any database.
- **SvelteKit-native** - Runs as part of your SvelteKit app. No separate server to manage.
- **Draft/Published workflow** - Built-in content staging with hash-based change detection and auto-save.
- **Multi-tenancy** - Organizations with row-level security out of the box.
- **Authentication** - Better Auth integration with email/password, API keys, and role-based access.
- **S3-compatible storage** - Works with AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, or local filesystem.
- **GraphQL API** - Auto-generated from your schemas.

## Architecture

Aphex follows a **hexagonal (ports & adapters)** architecture. The core engine (`@aphexcms/cms-core`) defines interfaces for database, storage, authentication, and email. Separate packages provide implementations:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@aphexcms/cms-core` | Core engine, admin UI, route handlers, types |
| `@aphexcms/postgresql-adapter` | PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM adapter |
| `@aphexcms/storage-s3` | S3-compatible storage (R2, AWS S3, MinIO) |
| `@aphexcms/graphql-plugin` | Auto-generated GraphQL API |
| `@aphexcms/resend-adapter` | Email via Resend |
| `@aphexcms/nodemailer-adapter` | Email via Nodemailer |
| `@aphexcms/ui` | Shared UI component library |
