**Heads up:** This project was scaffolded from `@aphexcms/base` `v0.0.1`.

what changed upstream and which files you may want to port into your
customized project.

# AphexCMS Template Changelog

Notes for users upgrading an existing project scaffolded from this template.
Because the template is meant to be customized, changes here are **not**
automatically applied to your project — this file describes what changed
upstream so you can cherry-pick the bits you care about.

Format: each entry lists the files touched and a one-line reason. Use
`git diff` against the mirror repo (`IcelandicIcecream/aphex-base`) at the
tag matching the version you started from to see the exact changes.

## Unreleased

_Add entries here as studio → template syncs land. Move to a versioned
section when cutting a release._

<!--
Example entry:

- **fix(members): reject self-invitation and duplicate members**
  - `src/routes/(protected)/admin/settings/members/+page.svelte`
  - Handled server-side in cms-core; UI unchanged. Safe to skip if you
    haven't customized the invite flow.

- **feat(versions): add document versions API routes**
  - `src/routes/api/documents/[id]/versions/+server.ts`
  - `src/routes/api/documents/[id]/versions/[version]/+server.ts`
  - `src/routes/api/documents/[id]/versions/[version]/restore/+server.ts`
  - Clean re-exports from `@aphexcms/cms-core/server`. Port these over to
    get version history in your admin UI.
